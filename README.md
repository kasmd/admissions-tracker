# Admissions Tracker

This project is an Admissions Tracker built using Ruby on Rails. This was a collaborative effort by:
[Max Peterson](https://github.com/maxrpeterson), 
[Anila Alexander](https://github.com/anilajalex), 
[Dor Rubin](https://github.com/dorrubin), 
[Sam Hu](https://github.com/samuelhuxiali), and 
[Kelly Devine](https://github.com/KellyD813)

## Features

The Admissions Tracker was built for four types of users: Potential Candidates, Existing Candidates, Admissions Officers, and Instructors. All users are able to view courses and the course specifics. 
Potential candidates are able to apply for a particular course and then view a candidate profile that displays their submitted application information.
Admissions Officers can log into the site and view potential candidates and access a questionnaire for a phone screen. A timer is available on the questionnaire for use by the Admissions Officer.
Instructors are also able to log into the site and view potential candidates. Instructors can access a questionnaire for an in-person interview.
